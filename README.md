# UniversalOsDevQuestionCheckList (uodqcl)
A checklist for beginners to check before asking questions


### Basics before asking
- you should be proficient in the language you're developing your OS in (but you don't necessarily have to be an expert)
- :warning::warning::warning: :rotating_light: READ THIS FIRST AND DO NOT THINK IT DOESN'T APPLY TO YOU https://wiki.osdev.org/Required_Knowledge :rotating_light: :warning::warning::warning:
- Have you checked the os dev wiki for an answer.(if you have but you don't understand then please tell people that in your question so people don't make you read the wiki).
- Check for typos (They happen a lot).
- Read your compiler errors and try to understand them so your not asking basic programming questions (normally you can find the answers to compiler errors on stackoverflow or look it up on a search engine).
- If your on linux and you installed a cross compiler and it says its not a command, please check your path or that it was installed correctly.
- Be specific, we are not mind readers. Include all the information needed for someone to understand who hasnâ€™t been staring at the problem for the past hour
